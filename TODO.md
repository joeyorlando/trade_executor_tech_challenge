# Still TODO

- [ ] create an HTTP endpoint that executes an order (POST endpoint that takes a symbol, order size and price as input)
- [ ] connect to the binance order book ticker stream (https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#individual-symbol-book-ticker-streams)
- [ ] write to sqlite-db: output summary on how the order was split
- [ ] write unit tests
- [ ] explain next steps on how I would further improve this solution
